# Changelog (personal progress)

High-level notes for **this fork / branch** (`feature/multi-ui-layouts-v0.5`).  
Version = `version.py` / Git tag when you run `.\release.ps1` or tag manually.

## v0.5.12

- **View** menu on all layouts: **Full screen** (F11) with friendlier splitter ratios on large displays; **Pop out survey stats** (Ctrl+Shift+S) — large, optional always-on-top window for Hypack / multi-monitor survey ops (Cube COM NMEA path vs MAVLink called out in UI copy).

## v0.5.11

- `verify_all.py` imports are complete on a fresh clone (`py_interpreter`, extra tests).
- Skip `com_free` / headless / stress when the bench UDP port is already bound (bridge GUI running); `VERIFY_ALL_NO_SKIP=1` forces the full suite.
- Shared `ui/stats_line.py`, serial timeout log coalescing, and tests for stats line / log / survey contract.
- Bench stress uses the same Python executable selection as other scripts.

## v0.5.5

- Live bridge stats in the UI (rolling Hz, inject rate, session line counts) plus tooltips.
- `bridge_core` counters/metrics and `test_bridge_metrics`; `verify_all` runs that test.
- Desktop/launcher shortcuts and `launch_bridge_gui_menu.bat`; `_gen_mixin.py` for shared UI mixin code.

## v0.5.2 and earlier (see git)

- Multi-UI layouts (Standard / Minimal / Log-first), launcher picker for frozen exe, README bench/boat workflow (`c881cfa` and neighbors).

**Documenting a new drop:** bump `version.py`, commit, add a section above, then:

- `.\release.ps1` — build + zip under `dist\`
- `gh auth login` — once per PC that publishes
- `.\release.ps1 -Publish` — tag + GitHub Release + upload zip  
  If publish failed after a successful build: `.\release.ps1 -PublishOnly` (no PyInstaller rerun).

**Many PCs:** they only download the **Release zip** from GitHub (or you copy `dist\…zip`); no clone required on those machines.
